<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Tebogo Khiba is a seasoned Graphic Designer based in Johannesburg. I am currently employed as GD at PG Glass
    and I work with the Marketing Team, assisting them with everything graphic design. I love my 
    work because I get exposed to different visual and design problems that I solve with my Team daily. 
    PG Glass has a central marketing team that serves the company nationally. As marketing we are 
    resposible for the companys marketing and visual appearance. This exposes me to
    all a graphic designer can wish to get their hands on; from powerpoint designs, internal communication templates,
    poster / flyer designs, taking photos of the team and editing for distribution and posting on social media, newsletter designs,
    to store and vehicle signage designs. The work doesn't stop there. I manage projects from brief to print to distribution.
